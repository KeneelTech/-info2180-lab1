 <h2>Keneel Thomas</h2>
 <p>I am a fan of Anime, games and listening to music. I enjoy peace and quite and chilling by myself even though 
    I dont really eat much I enjoy eating food especially stew peas with pig tail. I am
    interested in web development because I like how html and css is structure that it feels
    like it gives me full control of how I can create and customize webpages and I like
    having the optionals of being able to customize things how I want it also I believe
    it i a very good skill to have for a programmer to be able to create your own unique
    webpage to showcase to clients and businesses to let them know your skills before
    meeting you.
